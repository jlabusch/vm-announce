This is the seed of an idea for managing the various VMs I have on my
home and work computers. Because their networks are always changing and
I don't necessarily have control of things like DNS, I need another kind
of service discovery method.

Needs more work; what's holding it up right now is that I haven't got
TXT records working yet.
